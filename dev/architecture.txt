FrontController(?) is the base class for other UI controllers. FrontController has methods that validate data and has attributes for the UI texts.
InputControllers extend the FrontController. These take the user input and call methods on the service layer, and show the results to user.
Service layer calls the model classes.
Model classes model the interval handling.
Persistence logic is dealt by separate mappers, which are called by the service layer.
