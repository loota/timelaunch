The application should enable the user to be notified at given
intervals with audio. This should be accomplished with a subsystem that allows also arbitrary commands instead of just audio and there should be a possibility to run different kinds of commands inside a single session. 
There must be support for intervals synchronized, random and explicitly listed. With a single
invocation of the program the user should be able to specify several sessions.
User must be able to define intervals with the granularity of one second.

These sessions may be possible to be saved and loaded.
